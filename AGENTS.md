# Agent guidance

## Game development skills

For broad Space Typing tasks, start with
[space-typing-director](.agents/skills/space-typing-director/SKILL.md).
For a focused task, load only the relevant project specialist and its references.
Project contracts and the current source take precedence over generic skill defaults;
plans and checkpoints must be checked against the current implementation.

Use installed OpenAI Game Studio and `threejs-*` specialists for engine, graphics,
assets, UI implementation, profiling and browser QA. Their scaffolds and release
checklists do not expand the user's task or replace existing project architecture.

Canonical project skills live in `.agents/skills`. Update those first; use
`bash scripts/sync-agent-skills.sh` for conflict-checked Claude copies.
Launch the agent from the parent project root; an independently opened Git
submodule does not inherit these parent skill folders.
See [setup and validation](docs/AGENT_SKILLS_SETUP.md) for commands and discovery.
